# Welcome to my TikTok Scraper Project #

With this project I wanted to just make Tik Tok Compilatios and post them to YouTube. 

## How to use ##

1. Find link to TikTok page with videos on it.

2. Find the wrapper that holds in href or link in the html of that page

3. Connect and download the necessary authentication for YouTube API

4. Specify the title, description, and other info about your video

5. Run main.py

6. In the window that Selenium opens, log in to TikTok, then allow it to scroll

7. When it directs you, pick the google acct you configured for this YouTube API Project

8. Enjoy your video!
